## Contributions

Improvements are welcome. I'm new to ruby and there's certainly room for improvement.  

### How to edit

Go to Language>User Defined Language>Define your language and set user language to eRuby with the dropdown at the top.  
The documentation for this feature is [here](https://ivan-radic.github.io/udl-documentation/ "Welcome to UDL documentation site | UDL docs") and is fairly extensive.

### Design principles

These are the things that I _don't_ want to change.

* only ruby code in bold (as much as possible)
* ruby code with a colour that matches its name
* keep the look of html reasonably similar to notepad++'s normal html highlighting

Names of common classes and methods are surely a clear area for improvement for instance.
